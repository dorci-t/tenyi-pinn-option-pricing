Sampling utilities for the PINN training points.

The project does not use an external training dataset for the main benchmark.
Instead, we generate synthetic points from the Black-Scholes PDE domain:
interior points for the PDE residual, terminal points for the payoff condition,
and boundary points for the boundary conditions.
